# Hello, folks! <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">
I'm a passionate **Full Stack Developer** who thrives on building projects from inception to realization, relishing every stage of the development process. I find immense joy in delving deep into technologies and frameworks to truly understand how they work.

Professionally, I've had the opportunity to work with a range of technologies, including React (both web and native), Node.js, and Java (specifically Spring Boot). However, my passion for technology extends beyond the workplace. I thrive on creating side projects, which not only serve as a creative outlet but also provide an opportunity to delve into new frameworks and languages. This continuous exploration broadens my problem-solving perspective and keeps my skills sharp. I embrace challenges wholeheartedly, which is why I actively seek to use frameworks and languages I haven't encountered before whenever I embark on a new project. It's the perfect way to keep pushing my boundaries and expanding my horizons.
